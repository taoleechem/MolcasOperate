\section{Basic Principle}
Time-correlated single photon counting allows us to measure the time that a molecule stays in its excited state following excitation. The technique works as follows: a laser pulse hits the sample.  After the molecules in the sample are excited, they can decay back to the ground state via several pathways, such as internal conversion, fluorescence, and intersystem crossing to the triplet state.  The sample goes back to the ground state at a rate at the sum of all the possible decay pathways; the reciprocal of this rate is the excited state lifetime. Even if fluorescence is not the fastest decay pathway, the relaxation is a discrete, probabilistic process.  As a result, there is some Poisson probability of detecting fluorescence photons.  We can detect these photons using a PMT and build up an exponential decay.  Fitting this decay gives us the excited state, or fluorescence, lifetime. \par 
Set the initial fluorescence time as zero, the fluorescence spectra obeys the following formula:
\begin{equation}
I=I_{0}e^{-t/\tau}
\end{equation}
Hence the lifetime is easy to be calculated from spectra data.\par 
Moreover, anistrotropy property of molecule in solution can also be obtained using TCSPC. Anistrotropy r is defined as
\begin{equation}
r=\frac{T_{\parallel}-I_{\perp}}{T_{\parallel}+2I_{\perp}}
\end{equation}
If the molecules obeys totally random distribution, $r=0.4$. In the spectra of anistrotropy in TCSPC, 
\begin{equation}
r(t)=r_{0}e^{-t/\theta}
\end{equation}
where $\theta$ represents the rotation correlation time.
\begin{equation}
\theta =\frac{\eta V}{RT}
\end{equation}
where $\eta$ represents the viscosity of solution. So after obtaining the value of $\theta$ from spectra, the volume of molecule V could be calculated directly.

\section{Channel Time Correspondance}
Firstly, we do experiment on the channel time correspondance. In original data, x axis represents channels, which has a linear correspondace towards time.\par 

\begin{table}[]
\centering
\caption{Channel time correspondance data}
\label{my-label}
\begin{tabular}{@{}lllllll@{}}
\toprule
channels & 238 & 388 & 687 & 990 & 1291 & 1595\\ \midrule
time/ns  & -6  & -4  & 0   &   4 & 8 & 12\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
According to data above, we could get the linear equation about channeal and time.

\section{Questions}
1.  Imagine two compounds with similar fluorescence quantum yields (e.g. $\Phi_{fl} = 1$) but very different
absorption coefficients ($\varepsilon$). Now assume two samples of these with similar absorption (at a given
wavelength). What would be the difference between their time-resolved fluorescence spectra? Consider
the total fluorescence and how the fluorescence would be distributed over time.\\ \par 

Since the quantum yields are the same, when 2 samples have similar absorption, the exponential fluorescence spectra have similar integral area. According to 
\begin{equation}
A=\log (\frac{I_0}{I})=\varepsilon cl
\end{equation}
the larger absorption coefficients $\varepsilon$ means smaller life time $\tau$. To make sure the same integral area, the intial value of I becomes larger and the spectra decreases faster.\\ \par 


2.  What is the influence of laser intensity fluctuations (say within Â±20\%) on the precision of the
measurement in a TCSPC life-time experiment? Compare that with an anisotropy measurement and with
fluorescence upconversion and transient absorption spectroscopy.\\ \par 
For life-time experiment, 20\% laser intensity flucturations do not influence the result becasue only 1\% intensity is measured for detection rather than the maximum value of the pulse.\par 
For anisotropy measurement, it influences the experiment results.\\ \par 

3. Discuss the different lifetimes that were obtained during the measurement for the different systems,
taking into account the environments. \\ \par 
From the lifetime experiment of D149 in solution state and solid state, we get the following results:
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=10cm]{result1}
\end{center}
Hence the lifetime of D149 in solid state is larger than that in liquid solution, which arises from the solid state restriction of the motion of D149.\\ \par 

4. Estimate the volume of rhodamine 6G in three different ways: a) use the (estimated) density and
molecular mass and calculate the volume, b) estimate the diameter of the molecule by assuming standard
bond lengths and calculate the corresponding volume if it was a sphere (how realistic is that model?), c)
calculate the volume based on the time-resolved data in ethanol.
Compare the three ways and comment on which you consider most reliable. \\ \par 
a) 
\begin{equation*}
V=\frac{m}{\rho}=\frac{479.02 g/mol}{1.26 g/cm^3\times 6.623\times 10^{23}/mol}=0.574 nm^3
\end{equation*}
b) Diameter is about 12 C-C bonds length, which is 0.154 nm.  
\begin{equation*}
V=\frac{4\pi r^3}{3}=\frac{4\times 3.14\times 0.077^3}{4}=1.91\times 10^{-3} nm^3
\end{equation*}
c)  \\ \par 

5. Based on the SPC data, calculate the rotational correlation time of rhodamine 6G in ethanol and
ethanol/glycerol. Also, calculate the viscosity of the mixtures and compare to the calculated viscosity
based on a simple linear interpolation between those of the two pure solvents. \\ \par

6.  Given a new molecule with completely unknown photophysics/-chemistry, suggest a good strategy on
how to learn about possible processes that the molecule can undergo. Suggest possible techniques (flashphotolysis,
SPC, pump-probe, upconversion, streak camera, ...), why you use those and what you can
learn from these and what not (strengths and weaknesses). Keep in mind that practical aspects can be
quite important in many experiments. \\ \par
